# Keeper

Keeper is an Android app that remembers what you tell it!
Rather than having Facebook tell you about a person, write down and save what the person is to you.
A diary of sorts, you can make an entry on anything be it person, place, event, etc.

Things to work on: 
- enhanced user experience
- search functionality
- tag suggestions
- image saving
- facebook contact import with automated info
- sub memories for each entry
- editable entries
- online saving/accounts
